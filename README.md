Ristretto
============

A short shot of Espresso.

>A shorthand extension on top of Espresso.

Espresso's consistency makes it really easy to learn.

Want to match a view with a specific id? Use `withId(R.id.some_id)`.
Need to match with a piece of text? Use `withText(R.id.some_text)`
or `withText("some text)`.
Awesome, consistent and it's very clear what it is you are doing.

However...

After a few hours writing test code you'll find you're code being a little bit to verbose.
Not anymore.

Why should you need to explicitly specify that you are matching with some text if you are passing in some text as a parameter? Some for the view id, you can already see that it is a view id.

Ristretto allows you to write the same test code as you already write, but less verbose.
Let's see some examples.

##Espresso vs Ristretto

Simple replacements

| *Espresso* | *Ristretto* |
| ---- | ---- |
| `withId(R.id.some_id)` | `with(R.id.some_id)` |
| `withText(R.string.some_text)` | `with(R.string.some_text)` |
| `withText("some text")` | `with("some text")` |

In combination with `onView()`

| *Espresso* | *Ristretto* |
| ---- | ---- |
| `onView(withId(R.id.some_id))` | `withView(R.id.some_id)` |
| `onView(withText(R.string.some_text))` | `withView(R.string.some_text)` |
| `onView(withText("some text"))` | `withView("some text")` |

For displayed views

| *Espresso* | *Ristretto* |
| ---- | ---- |
| `onView(allOf(withId(R.id.some_id), isDisplayed()))` | `withDisplayedView(R.id.some_id)` |
| `onView(allOf(withText(R.string.some_text), isDisplayed()))` | `withDisplayedView(R.string.some_text)` |
| `onView(allOf(withText("some text"), isDisplayed()))` | `withDisplayedView("some text")` |

Ordering does not matter.
`onView(allOf(withId(R.id.some_id), isDisplayed()))` is equal to `onView(allOf(isDisplayed(), withId(R.id.some_id)))`.


##How to use

Configure your `build.gradle` and add one dependency and you are ready to go.

```groovy
dependencies {
    androidTestCompile project("com.appsingularity:ristretto:1.0.0")
}
```

##How to learn

Ristretto comes with a set of lint checks that will point out all the places where you can write Ristretto shorthand instead of the longform Espresso.
Just add the Ristretto Lint dependency to your `build.gradle`
```groovy
dependencies {
    debugCompile project("com.appsingularity:ristretto-lint:1.0.0")
}
```
>This will add only the generated `BuildConfig` (with only 1 method) to your code base. But the default Prouard or DexGaurd configuration will strip it out for you since nobody is using it.

###ProGuard
Since Ristretto adds no code to your app (except for the `BuildConfig`) you can safely use Ristretto in combination with ProGuard or DexGuard.
